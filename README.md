# Predictive_analysis_int
This project builds a predictive classification model using data preprocessing and five machine learning algorithms. After cleaning, encoding, splitting, and scaling the dataset, models like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree are trained and compared to identify the best performer.
