The dataset used in this project contains nutritional and physical characteristics of 39 different fruits. Each fruit is described using features such as sugar level, acidity, season, vitamins, minerals, water percentage, fiber, and shelf life. The target variable is the taste_profile, which categorizes fruits into taste groups like Sweet, Sour, Tart, Creamy, and Bitter.
This dataset is suitable for predictive analysis because it includes a mix of numerical and categorical features and a clearly defined target class for classification. I applied multiple machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression to predict the taste profile based on the given features.
